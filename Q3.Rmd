For the features with info both of borrower, one can see the similarity. 
The coborrowerâ€™s  income is higher, which might be the case parents are the co-borrower of the students. The meaning of dti is a ratio of debt payment and income. Co-borrower has a low ratio. They don't have a huge burden. 
The verification status is somehow interesting. Less co-borrowers are verified might due to the verification mechanism of Lending Club. 
Second applicants built a late credit line. They are elder. So they contact credit products later. 



### Second Plot

```{r, echo = F}
ls2017.joint.log <- ls2017.joint[, -(1:6)]


# Create coborrower's class
ls2017.joint.log[, cbClass := is.na(verification_status_joint) + 
                   is.na(annual_inc_joint_log) + 
                   is.na(dti_joint_log) + 
                   is.na(revol_bal_joint_log)]
ls2017.joint.log[, cbType := ifelse(cbClass == 0, "none", ifelse(cbClass == 4, "all", "med"))]
ls2017.joint.log[, ":="(int_rate = ls2017$int_rate, loan_status = ls2017$loan_status, 
                        loan_amnt = ls2017$loan_amnt, grade = ls2017$grade)]

## let the class be balanced to do better visualization 
## cbType: none missing(10%) in "_joint", 1~3 missing(1%), all missing(89%)
a <- table(ls2017.joint.log$cbType)

set.seed(101)
allInd_inv <- sample(which(ls2017.joint.log$cbType == "all"), a[1] - a[3])


p21 <- ggplot(ls2017.joint.log[-allInd_inv], aes(x = annual_inc_log, y = int_rate, col = cbType)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_jitter(height = 2, width = 0, cex = .1) + 
  ggtitle("Interest Rate VS Annual Income (with or without Coborrowers")



p22 <- ggplot(ls2017.joint.log[-allInd_inv], aes(x = verification_status, y = cbType)) + 
  geom_raster(aes(fill = int_rate), hjust = .5, vjust = .5, interpolate = F) + 
  ggtitle("Interest Rate VS Verification Status (with or without Coborrowers")
grid.arrange(p21, p22, ncol = 1)
```

The cbType, referring to co-borrower's type, is defined as follows. All means the applicant has a co-borrower, none means no, and med denotes the applicant's co-borrower information is partially missing. 
If we add one response, e.g. interest rate, one can see a separate pattern against annual income under the cbType. 
As for verification status, the trends differs a lot among these 3 cbTypes.

A casual linear regression is also applied and result in a slight decrease of the prediction error.
